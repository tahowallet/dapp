# Release checklist

This release checklist should be performed before release is published.

- if something is not working please create an issue and link it here. Checkbox
  should be checked only if everything was fine
- in case of serious issues or doubts you should ask the team first

**Approve the PR when the checklist is finished âœ…**

**Merge the PR when it is approved and we want to update the production
environment ðŸš€**
