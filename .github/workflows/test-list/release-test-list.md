# Release checklist

This release checklist should be performed before release is published.

- if something is not working please create an issue and link it here. Checkbox
  should be checked only if everything was fine
- in case of serious issues or doubts you should ask the team first

**Approve the PR when the checklist is finished âœ…**

**Merge the PR when it is approved and we want to update the production
environment ðŸš€**

## Manual tests

*many of these tests can be combined with each other as you're testing. I suggest looking through the whole checklist first then executing tests in a way that allows you to check off multiple items at once. Some suggestions are provided.


1. Connect to wallet that previously staked
   - [ ] you see the Portal is Open message
   - [ ] you can see the map after entering
   - [ ] you see your address connected
   - [ ] you see the name of your realm
   - [ ] you can navigate to other realms but not stake in them
   - [ ] you can stake more TAHO in that realm if you're not fully staked
   - [ ] you can unstake

2. Connect to wallet that hasn't staked but has $TAHO
   - [ ] you see the Portal is Open message
   - [ ] you can see the map after entering
   - [ ] you see your address connected
   - [ ] you don't see a realm name beside that
   - [ ] you can explore realms and stake into one (if you staked above, you don't have to do it again. Just make sure to test stake and unstake at least once)

3. Connect to wallet that has NO $TAHO (& no $VETAHO)
   - [ ] you see the portal is closed message and the wait list button
   - [ ] wait list redirect works as expected
   - [ ] you can't see the map

4. Switch connected wallet in the extension (it's easy to check these off along with the above while you're switching accounts)
   - [ ] dapp reloads and shows the portal screen
   - [ ] reloads with Connect Wallet button if you go to a wallet that's not
         connected
   - [ ] reloads with that address connected if that's a connected website for
         the address: if it's an eligible address, you see Access Granted &
         Enter the portal
   - [ ] reloads with that address connected if that's a connected website for
         the address: if it's an inelligible address, you see the portal is
         closed message and wait list button

5. Helper Tool
   - [ ] doesn't pop up automatically for users who have visited before and
         closed it
   - [ ] doesn't pop up automatically for staked users
   - [ ] does come up with the correct message when you click it (standard
         "hang in there, Nomad...")
   - [ ] does come up properly for a user connecting for the first time and
         running through onboarding

6. Population (this is easily tested with the above when you're staking/unstaking - verify the population changes and then you've combined these tests with that)
   - [ ] shows on each realm
   - [ ] shows on the bottom bar
   - [ ] is updated appropriately if a new account stakes

7. Quests/Questline
   - [ ] shows on each realm as expected

8. Disconnect from dapp
   - [ ] click disconnect on address drop down and it disconnects and shows the
         portal screen

9. Connect Wallet
   - [ ] with Taho installed and default wallet
   - [ ] with Taho installed and not default
   - [ ] with Taho not installed and no other - should be directed to the Chrome store to download Taho & given a message in the dapp to do so
   - [ ] with Taho not installed and MM installed - should be directed to the Chrome store to download Taho & given a message in the dapp to do so

10. XP
   - [ ] an account with XP to claim sees that under Claimable Rewards on the Realm modal (in pre-prod we can see this on stage-live but might be easiest to only test this when we're testing XP drops)
   - [ ] account can claim XP and sees the wallet balance of VETAHO change accordingly (requires that the account earned XP and hasn't claimed it yet so this could be hard to test on each release but when we're testing XP drops, we should do this)
   - [ ] leaderboard shows the top 10 earners in the realm - the connected account is shown at the top with their place on the board shown
