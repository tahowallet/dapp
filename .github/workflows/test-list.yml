# This workflow adds a comment with tests list to the PRs with the release
# candidates (PRs that want to merge `release-*` branches to `main`). The test
# list is specified in the `./.github/workflows/test-list/release-test-list.md`
# file. The comment is added only once, right after the PR gets created.
